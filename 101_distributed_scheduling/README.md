# Distributed Scheduling

Please write a design document about distributed scheduling and impeachment it.

Evaluation aspects:
- Learning ability
- Depth of thinking on single-point issues
- Hands-on ability

## Background

In all cloud providers, like AWS, Google, and others, there are many spot instances.
They are quite cheap (10% of the on-demand instances' price), but after you buy them,
they could be terminated with only two minutes' notice in advance (in most scenarios,
we don't set PDB, and we should perform the graceful drain).

So I want you to design a way to maximize the use of spot instances without service
interruption instead of on-demand instances, to cut costs, by using distributed scheduling
in a single cluster (on-demand/spot mixed or other methods for one workload).
This is important because all spot instances being terminated at the same time could
cause interruptions for different kinds of workloads (single replica workload, multiple replica workload).

Also, I don't want to change the scheduler already used in the K8s cluster and want to
ensure the minimal components necessary in the cluster.

Notes:
> 1. On demand nodes has label: node.kubernetes.io/capacity: on-demand.
> 2. Spot node has label: node.kubernetes.io/capacity: spot.
> 3. Workloads represented as Deployments and StatefulSets.
> 4. on-demand/spot instance represented as K8s nodes in the cluster.
> 5. Only focus on scheduling control; the graceful drain after receiving the terminal notification is handled by other components.

## Output

- A rough design document (English)
- An easy implementation (After talking to the interviewer)
